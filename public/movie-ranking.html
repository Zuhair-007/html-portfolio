<h1>The Best Movies according to Zuhair</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>John Wick</h3>
    <p>The most infamous madman who kills basically hundreds of people because someone killed his dog. The action is priceless</p>
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
    <p>The movie that skyrocketed the Marvel Cinematic Universe to where it is today.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train Arc</h3>
    <p>Still brings me tears to this day. Amazing visuals and action like the rest of the Demon Slayer series.</p>
